            <title>Episode Ten: This Country</title>
            <description>It was the biggest bank robbery in British and Irish history. Days before Christmas 2004, gangs
                of armed men take over the homes of two Northern Bank officials in Belfast and County Down. With family
                members held hostage, the officials are instructed to remove cash from the vaults of Northern Bank
                headquarters in Belfast city-centre and load it into the back of a van - not once, but twice - before
                the van disappears into the night, along with more than Â£26.5 million in new and used notes. With the
                finger of blame pointed at the IRA, the raid makes headlines around the world and sends shock-waves
                through an already faltering Northern Ireland peace process.

                Through dramatized court testimonies, new interviews and archive, Glenn Patterson takes us into the
                unfolding story of a meticulously planned heist and its chaotic aftermath. Military precision giving way
                to soap powder boxes stuffed with cash. The bickering of politicians against the silence of the man said
                to be the robberyâs mastermind. There are even rumours that proceeds from the robbery are to be used
                as a pension fund for IRA members as it prepares to disarm and disband.


                Glenn Patterson has unfinished business with the Northern Bank Job. In fact, he thinks all of Northern
                Ireland does.

                Episode Ten: This Country
                So where did all the money go? And what went with it?

            <title>Episode Seven: Burning Embers</title>
            <description>It was the biggest bank robbery in British and Irish history. Days before Christmas 2004, gangs
                of armed men take over the homes of two Northern Bank officials in Belfast and County Down. With family
                members held hostage, the officials are instructed to remove cash from the vaults of Northern Bank
                headquarters in Belfast city-centre and load it into the back of a van - not once, but twice - before
                the van disappears into the night, along with more than Â£26.5 million in new and used notes. With the
                finger of blame pointed at the IRA, the raid makes headlines around the world and sends shock-waves
                through an already faltering Northern Ireland peace process.

                Through dramatized court testimonies, new interviews and archive, Glenn Patterson takes us into the
                unfolding story of a meticulously planned heist and its chaotic aftermath. Military precision giving way
                to soap powder boxes stuffed with cash. The bickering of politicians against the silence of the man said
                to be the robberyâs mastermind. There are even rumours that proceeds from the robbery are to be used
                as a pension fund for IRA members as it prepares to disarm and disband.

                Glenn Patterson has unfinished business with the Northern Bank Job. In fact, he thinks all of Northern
                Ireland does.

                Episode Seven: Burning Embers
                Irish police follow a money laundering trail to County Cork, where someone is going to extreme lengths
                to get the cash off their hands

                shock-waves through an already faltering Northern Ireland peace process.

                Through dramatized court testimonies, new interviews and archive, Glenn Patterson takes us into the
                unfolding story of a meticulously planned heist and its chaotic aftermath. Military precision giving way
                to soap powder boxes stuffed with cash. The bickering of politicians against the silence of the man said
                to be the robberyâs mastermind. There are even rumours that proceeds from the robbery are to be used
                as a pension fund for IRA members as it prepares to disarm and disband.

                Glenn Patterson has unfinished business with the Northern Bank Job. In fact, he thinks all of Northern
                Ireland does.

            <title>Episode Three: Progressing Matters</title>
            <description>It was the biggest bank robbery in British and Irish history. Days before Christmas 2004, gangs
                of armed men take over the homes of two Northern Bank officials in Belfast and County Down. With family
                members held hostage, the officials are instructed to remove cash from the vaults of Northern Bank
                headquarters in Belfast city-centre and load it into the back of a van - not once, but twice - before
                the van disappears into the night, along with more than Â£26.5 million in new and used notes. With the
                finger of blame pointed at the IRA, the raid makes headlines around the world and sends shock-waves
                through an already faltering Northern Ireland peace process.

                Through dramatized court testimonies, new interviews and archive, Glenn Patterson takes us into the
                unfolding story of a meticulously planned heist and its chaotic aftermath. Military precision giving way
                to soap powder boxes stuffed with cash. The bickering of politicians against the silence of the man said
                to be the robberyâs mastermind. There are even rumours that proceeds from the robbery are to be used
                as a pension fund for IRA members as it prepares to disarm and disband.

                Episode Three: Progressing Matters
                As Kevin and Chris make their way down to the basement cash-centre safe, the masked men holding Kyran
                McMullan hostage ask if she'd like some light refreshments...

            <title>Introducing The Northern Bank Job</title>
            <description>It was the biggest bank robbery in British and Irish history. Days before Christmas 2004, gangs
                of armed men take over the homes of two Northern Bank officials in Belfast and County Down. With family
                members held hostage, the officials are instructed to remove cash from the vaults of Northern Bank
                headquarters in Belfast city-centre and load it into the back of a van - not once, but twice - before
                the van disappears into the night, along with more than Â£26.5 million in new and used notes. With the
                finger of blame pointed at the IRA, the raid makes headlines around the world and sends shock-waves
                through an already faltering Northern Ireland peace process.

                Through dramatized court testimonies, new interviews and archive, Glenn Patterson takes us into the
                unfolding story of a meticulously planned heist and its chaotic aftermath. Military precision giving way
                to soap powder boxes stuffed with cash. The bickering of politicians against the silence of the man said
                to be the robberyâs mastermind. There are even rumours that proceeds from the robbery are to be used
                as a pension fund for IRA members as it prepares to disarm and disband.

                Glenn Patterson has unfinished business with the Northern Bank Job. In fact, he thinks all of Northern
                Ireland does.
